**Bitempura-viz visualizes the 2 dimensional valid time and transaction time "history" in a [Bitempura database](https://github.com/elh/bitempura).**

[Bitemporality](https://github.com/elh/bitempura#bitemporality) of data provides attractive data integrity and querying properties, but actually managing those records and reasoning about them can be quite confusing. The convention of visualizating these records with explicit valid time and transaction time start and end fields in a 2D chart was established as early as [Richard T. Snodgrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_T._Snodgrass)'s writings, but in the course of creating my own bitemporal database, I found it to be underused.

## Usage

The primary use case is to serve as a visual debugger for the development of Bitempura. Bitempura tests write [TestOutput](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/elh/bitempura/dbtest#TestOutput) files which contain the temporal history for relevant keys. This app must be provided those files at start up.

### Installation

```
(cd server && npm ci) && (cd client && npm ci)
````

### Running Locally

Bitempura-viz has a simple client-server set up. The server makes temporal histories available for the client to render.

1. Start the Express server w/ `TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` env var set to a path to a Bitempura `_testoutput/` dir to visualize.
```
(cd server; TEST_OUTPUT_DIR=<path to `_testoutput/`> node server.js)
# or
# (cd server; TEST_OUTPUT_DIR=<path to `_testoutput/`> npx nodemon server.js)
```

2. Start the React web app. Navigate to it at `http://localhost:3000/`.
```
(cd client; npm start)
````
